# Jordy Slagter's NeoVim config.

My own NeoVim config based on [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim).
LazyVim [documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) <-- available there.

This is a very minimal configuration that basically just configures the needed LSPs,
sets Oil as the default file explorer and adds rainbow delimiters.
